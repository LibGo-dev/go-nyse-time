## üåü How it works

The library uses the current time to determine if the market is open, closed, or early closed. It also determines if the current day is a holiday.

## üì¶ Installation and Usage

### Go

Make sure you have `Go` installed on your machine.

You can check by running the following command in the `console`

```plain
go version
```

If you don't have `Go` installed, you can download it from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).

### Add to your project

Run the following command in the `console`, in the `project directory`, to install the library with `go get`

```plain
go get github.com/octolibs/nyse-schedule
```

### Importing

Add the import to your `.go` file

```go
import "github.com/octolibs/nyse-schedule"
```

## üí∞ Usage

### Check if the Market is Open

```go
//Returns True or False
open := nyse.IsMarketOpen()
```

### Check if a time and date

```go
//Returns `Result` struct
stock := stocks.GetFullDetails("AAPL")
```

### Is Market Open?

```go
//Returns `bool`
isOpen := stocks.IsMarketOpen()
```

### Is Holiday?

```go
//Returns `bool`
isHoliday := stocks.IsHoliday()
```
