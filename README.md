## üåü How it works

The library uses the current time to determine if the market is open, closed, or closed early. It also determines if the current day is a holiday.

## üì¶ Installation and Usage

### Go

Make sure you have `Go` installed on your machine.

You can check by running the following command in the `console`

```plain
go version
```

If you don't have `Go` installed, you can download it from [here](https://go.dev/dl/).

### Add to your project

Run the following command in the `console`, in the `project directory`, to install the library with `go get`

```plain
go get github.com/ggoodwin/go-nyse-time
```

### Importing

Add the import to your `.go` file

```go
import nyse_time "github.com/ggoodwin/go-nyse-time"
```

## üí∞ Usage

### Check if the Market is Open at Current Time

```go
// Returns: bool
open := nyse_time.IsMarketOpen()
```

### Check if the Market will be Open based on a specific time and date

```go
// Parameters: time.Time
// Returns: bool
open := nyse_time.IsMarketOpenCustom(time.Time)
```

### Is It A Holiday?

```go
// Parameters: time.Time
// Returns: bool
isHoliday := nyse_time.IsHoliday(time.Time)
```

### Is It An Early Close Day?

```go
// Parameters: time.Time
// Returns: bool
isEarlyClose := nyse_time.IsEarlyClose(time.Time)
```

### Is It A Weekend?

```go
// Parameters: time.Time
// Returns: bool
isWeekend := nyse_time.IsWeekend(time.Time)
```
